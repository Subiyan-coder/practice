        <h3> Asta </h3>
        <p>He is a short-statured orphan raised at Hage church after being abandoned by his mother, Richita, shortly after birth.
           Unlike everyone else in the Clover Kingdom, who are born with magical ability, Asta is born without any mana, making him unable to use magic.
           Despite this, he possesses a unique ability called Anti-Magic, which allows him to nullify and repel magical energy.

           Killua, the middle child of the infamous Zoldyck assassin family, joins Gon after meeting him during the Hunter Exam, seeking freedom from his family's oppressive life.
